                    <br>
                    Finally I'm starting my own blog. Welcome :)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I've some knack to work with images, I'm going to go through a set
                    of posts in which I'll attempt to describe some operations on both
                    grayscale & color images. So, let's get started.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Say, we're given a grayscale binary image & asked to find inverted image,
                    <strong>what do we do to invert that image ?</strong>
                    <img class="imgCenter" src="0/img/0.jpg">
                    We'll simply flip each bit located at each pixel.
                    <img class="imgCenter" src="0/img/1.jpg">
                    But in case of binary images, we can have only two possible
                    levels of color i.e. {0, 1} = {black, white}. To represent more colors we need
                    to use more bits. So, we're going to use 8-bit color intensity
                    values. Using 8-bits we can represent x, be an unsigned
                    integers | x âˆˆ [0, 255] i.e. now we can represent 256 color levels, where 0 & 255
                    denotes black & white respectively.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If we're asked to invert this image, <strong>what do we do ?</strong>
                    <img class="imgCenter" src="0/img/2.jpg">
                    We'll find bitwise NOT ( ~ ) of each pixel intensity across whole image.
                    <img class="imgCenter" src="0/img/3.jpg">
                    Upto this point things were pretty easy. Now we're going to deal with color images.
                    So we'll work with 24-bit RGB images i.e. each pixel location will hold 3 basic color
                    components namely Red, Green & Blue.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="noteText">Note : RGB color model is additive in nature i.e. adding
                        three different color components results into final color.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For that we've to apply bitwise NOT operator on each pixel for each of three
                    color components.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Say we're given with this image.
                    <img class="imgCenter" src="0/img/4.jpg">
                    And we're going to invert it
                    <img class="imgCenter" src="0/img/5.jpg">
                    We already know an image can be represented as matrix
                    of size <strong>M x N</strong>, where given image is of width <strong>N</strong>
                    & height <strong>M</strong>. Till now we were processing image matrix sequentially, but
                    how about we consider concurrent processing of multiple pixels, leveraging
                    power of modern multi-theaded multi-core CPUs.
                    <br>
                    For concurrent processing of image matrix we can use SIMD model of concurrent
                    computation, where we'll split image matrix into <strong>M</strong>
                    row vectors and each row to be processed by different thread of execution. That
                    will definitely decrease time complexity to <strong>O( N )</strong>, where N = #-of pixels along
                    horizontal direction
                    in image.
                    <br>
                    Let's talk about best case scenario, when we can afford
                    <strong>M * N</strong> number of processors, we'll obtain
                    result in constant time i.e. O( 1 ).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span class="noteText">Note : Instead of applying bitwise NOT ( ~ ) operator on each pixel
                        intensity, we
                        can also consider subtracting pixel intensity from 255 ( max intensity value for 8-bit image )
                        --- returns
                        same result.
                    </span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before wrapping it up, I'd like to mention my open source project
                    <a href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/filterIt" class="simpleLink">filterIt</a>
                    which is a pure Java implementation of different image processing operations. If you'd
                    like to check image inversion implementation, <a
                        href="https://github.com/itzmeanjan/filterIt/blob/master/in/itzmeanjan/filterit/transform/InverseImageTransformation.java"
                        class="simpleLink">here</a> it's. I'm seeking contribution in development of
                    <strong>filterIt</strong>.
                    <br>
